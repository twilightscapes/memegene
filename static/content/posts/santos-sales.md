## Georgie Hustle revealed as one of George Santos alter-egos
<br />

A pager found on a subway has revealed a secret life of George Santos or as he is known in the used auto sales industry: Georgie Hustle.

According to Georgie Hustle's sales page he is a three-time nominee of Salesman of the Year. An award that he apparently won this year. We're still trying to verify these reports and investigations are still underway.

In a video, Santos appears to be selling a special undercoating that he claims "helps protect the vehicle from potholes and provides for a boost of at least 10 MPG on long trips".

We'll bring you more information as soon as it happens.
