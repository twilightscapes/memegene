## Trump wears excessive makeup in order to hide wounds that he caused himself

During Trump's administration, it apparently had became all too common in the White House to find the limp body of the asphyxiophilic ex-Predident, usually naked and with genitalia in hand. Often with weird sex toys present and pornographic material that appeared to be photoshopped photos of Ivanka.

### Trump is said to be addicted to nitro poppers and Autoerotic Asphyxiation: A Dangerous Sexual Practice that involves hanging oneself while masturbating.

With evidence of masturbatory activity, the presence of sexually stimulating paraphernalia, the use of bondage, interconnecting restraints show that he has a very dysfunctional sex life and probably explains his numerous wives and mistresses.

Attempts to increase **masturbatory sensations** by reducing the oxygen to the brain may be attempted through a noose or ligature around the neck or nitrous oxide injected into a bag over the head. Oxygen deprivation, danger, and fantasy combine to bring heightened sexual gratification to those who engage in such activities. 

Death from such an activity may result from failures of the victim's psychological mechanism, the self-rescue device, and the victim's judgment and ability to control a self-endangering fantasy scenario.
